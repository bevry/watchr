###
Now to make watching files more convient and managed, we'll create a class which we can use to attach to each file.
It'll provide us with the API and abstraction we need to accomplish difficult things like recursion.
We'll also store a global store of all the watchers and their paths so we don't have multiple watchers going at the same time
for the same file - as that would be quite ineffecient.
Events:
- `log` for debugging, receives the arguments `logLevel ,args...`
- `error` for gracefully listening to error events, receives the arguments `err`
- `watching` for when watching of the path has completed, receives the arguments `err, watcherInstance, isWatching`
- `change` for listening to change events, receives the arguments `changeType, fullPath, currentStat, previousStat`

	Listener
	A change event has fired

	Things to note:
	- watchFile:
		- currentStat still exists even for deleted/renamed files
		- for deleted and updated files, it will fire on the file
		- for created files, it will fire on the directory
	- fsWatcher:
		- eventName is either 'change' or 'rename', this value cannot be trusted
		- currentStat still exists even for deleted/renamed files
		- previousStat is accurate, however we already have this
		- for deleted and changed files, it will fire on the file
		- for new files, it will fire on the directory

	Arguments for our change listener will be:
	- for updated files the arguments will be: `'update', fullPath, currentStat, previousStat`
	- for created files the arguments will be: `'create', fullPath, currentStat, null`
	- for deleted files the arguments will be: `'delete', fullPath, null, previousStat`

	In the future we will add:
	- for renamed files: 'rename', fullPath, currentStat, previousStat, newFullPath
	- rename is possible as the stat.ino is the same for the delete and create
