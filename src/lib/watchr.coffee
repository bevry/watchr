###
Now to make watching files more convient and managed, we'll create a class which we can use to attach to each file.
It'll provide us with the API and abstraction we need to accomplish difficult things like recursion.
We'll also store a global store of all the watchers and their paths so we don't have multiple watchers going at the same time
for the same file - as that would be quite ineffecient.
Events:
- `log` for debugging, receives the arguments `logLevel ,args...`
- `error` for gracefully listening to error events, receives the arguments `err`
- `watching` for when watching of the path has completed, receives the arguments `err, watcherInstance, isWatching`
- `change` for listening to change events, receives the arguments `changeType, fullPath, currentStat, previousStat`

	- `listeners` (optional, defaults to null) multiple event listeners, forwarded to @listen
	- `stat` (optional, defaults to `null`) a file stat object to use for the path, instead of fetching a new one
	- `ignoreHiddenFiles` (optional, defaults to `false`) whether or not to ignored files which filename starts with a `.`
	- `ignoreCommonPatterns` (optional, defaults to `true`) whether or not to ignore common undesirable file patterns (e.g. `.svn`, `.git`, `.DS_Store`, `thumbs.db`, etc)
	- `ignoreCustomPatterns` (optional, defaults to `null`) any custom ignore patterns that you would also like to ignore along with the common patterns
	- `interval` (optional, defaults to `100`) for systems that poll to detect file changes, how often should it poll in millseconds
	- `persistent` (optional, defaults to `true`) whether or not we should keep the node process alive for as long as files are still being watched

	Listener
	A change event has fired

	Things to note:
	- watchFile:
		- currentStat still exists even for deleted/renamed files
		- for deleted and updated files, it will fire on the file
		- for created files, it will fire on the directory
	- fsWatcher:
		- eventName is always 'change'
		- 'rename' is not yet implemented by node
		- currentStat still exists even for deleted/renamed files
		- previousStat is accurate, however we already have this
		- for deleted and changed files, it will fire on the file
		- for new files, it will fire on the directory

	Arguments for our change listener will be:
	- for updated files the arguments will be: `'update', fullPath, currentStat, previousStat`
	- for created files the arguments will be: `'create', fullPath, currentStat, null`
	- for deleted files the arguments will be: `'delete', fullPath, null, previousStat`

	In the future we will add:
	- for renamed files: 'rename', fullPath, currentStat, previousStat, newFullPath
	- rename is possible as the stat.ino is the same for the delete and create

	Close
	We will need something to close our listener for removed or renamed files

###
Create Watcher
Checks to see if the path actually exists, if it doesn't then exit gracefully
If it does exist, then lets check our cache for an already existing watcher instance
If we have an already existing watching instance, then just add our listeners to that
If we don't, then create a watching instance
Fire the next callback once done
next(err,watcherInstance)
###
createWatcher = (opts,next) ->
	# Prepare
	{path,listener,listeners} = opts

	# If next exists within the configuration, then use that as our next handler, if our next handler isn't already defined
	# Eitherway delete the next handler from the config if it exists
	if opts.next?

###
Watch
Provides an abstracted API that supports multiple paths
If you are passing in multiple paths then do not rely on the return result containing all of the watchers
you must rely on the result inside the completion callback instead
If you used the paths option, then your results will be an array of watcher instances, otherwise they will be a single watcher instance
next(err,results)
###

		# Extract it and delte it from the opts
