Watchr is used to be nofitied when a change happens to, or within a directory.
You will not be notified what file was changed, or how it was changed.
It will track new files and their changes too, and remove listeners for deleted files appropriatly.

The source code here is written as an experiment of literate programming
Which means you would be able to understand it, without knowing code
###

# Require the node.js file system module
# This provides us with what we need to interact with the file system (aka files and directories)
fs = require('fs')

# Require the node.js event emitter
# This provides us with the event system that we use for binding and trigger events
EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter

# Require the balUtil module
# This provides us with various flow logic and path utilities
balUtil = require('bal-util')

# Let's set the debugging mode
# We will use this later on when outputting messages that make our code easier to debug
# Note: when we publish the module, we want to set this as off, as we don't want the application using us
#  to spurt our all our debug messages!
debug = false

# Now to make watching files more convient and managed, we'll create a class which we can use to attach to each file
# It'll provide us with the API and abstraction we need to accomplish difficult things like recursion
# We'll also store a global store of all the watchers and their paths so we don't have multiple watchers going at the same time
#  for the same file - as that would be quite ineffecient
watchers = {}

	path: null

	# Is it a directory or not?
	isDirectory: null

	# Our fs.stat object, it contains things like change times, size, and is it a directory

	# The node.js file watcher instance, we have to open and close this, it is what notifies us of the events
	fswatcher: null

	# This is for when we are watching a directory, we will scan the directory and children go here
